## Purpose

For professionals seeking to make more rigorous, resilient, and transparent decisions—especially in complex environments.

## The 7 Questions

1. **What is happening in the market or environment and why?**
   - Gain an unfiltered understanding of external forces

2. **What have we been asked to achieve and why?**
   - Reframe the brief to find the root issue

3. **What outcomes will define success?**
   - Separate activities from real impact

4. **What options do we really have?**
   - Generate multiple courses of action

5. **How will each option perform under stress?**
   - Test paths against adversity

6. **What could go wrong—and when will we know?**
   - Build early warning systems

7. **How do we stay in control—while staying flexible?**
   - Balance governance with adaptability

## Quick Start

Take 30 minutes to:
1. List 3 market assumptions you've never verified
2. Write the problem you think you're solving vs what you're asked to solve
3. Define one success metric that could backfire if achieved

If these exercises reveal surprises, invest 4 hours in the full framework.
